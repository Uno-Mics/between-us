## Notes
- Authentication uses a "Couple Key" system.
- Storing authentication state in local context/storage as the API implies token-based or key-based auth.
- The UI relies heavily on the "Lora" serif font for headers to create the requested "cozy/intimate" aesthetic.
- Glassmorphism and soft shadows are used for depth.
